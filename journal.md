If I were in charge, I would allow every game website as long as everyone's work was done and they had 100% nothing left to do. I think that would make people like school slightly more. Also, maybe allow chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Character.ai because character.ai can help with relationships(rarely, though). Of course, no sites like Tumblr, (The Hub), or any harmful websites or malware will be allowed.

It could be that the car is just failing to detect the difference between what's a stop sign and what's just something random. But I think it could also be that Waymo is really not caring about what happens to people, because they're only in it for the money.
